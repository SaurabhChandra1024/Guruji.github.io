								<p>Aparimay Shyam Das Ji was born in a cultured Kanyakubja Brahmin family. From a young age, he was surrounded by a spiritual and devotional environment. His grandmother had a desire that her son's first child would be a boy, and she had prayed that if a boy was born, she would have a Bhagavat Katha (a Hindu scripture) recited. It is said that the Bhagavat Katha was the reason for the birth of Acharya Shyam Das on the day of Trayodashi (Pradosh Vrat).</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/36.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>In terms of family life, his mother and grandfather were also devoted to reciting the Ramayana, and Aparimay Shyam Das began reciting the Hanuman Chalisa and performing Hanuman Sadhana from the age of five.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/22.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>In 2006, he visited the ISKCON temple in East of Kailash, Delhi, where he met devotees and came into contact with the teachings of Param Pujya Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj. He began attending satsangs and studying the books of Prabhupada.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/37.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Later, in 2008, he had a realisation that death is inevitable and can occur at any moment, and that all his worldly achievements would be rendered meaningless. He decided to focus on spiritual pursuits and discussed this with his wife, who supported his decision. She said that the same God who feeds all living beings would take care of them as well.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/26.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>However, the next seven years were filled with struggles. During this time, Param Pujya Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj initiated Harinama Diksha in 2011 and Brahmana Diksha (Vaishnava Diksha) in 2013 in Vrindavan.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/27.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<P>In 2008, he returned to his birthplace, Etawah, with the intention of spreading the teachings of his guru and Prabhupada. He began preaching and started a weekly satsang, which continued uninterrupted from 2009 to 2015. He organised the first Jagannath Ratha Yatra in Etawah, which was attended by 10,000 devotees, and also organised other events like Janmashtami Mahotsav.</P>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/29.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Dr. Ashok Dikshit donated about one acre of land in a prime location in Etawah to ISKCON, and Acharya Shyam Das got the land registered with the help of devotees and his parents. In 2015, he moved to Lucknow and took over as the president of ISKCON, where he began spreading spiritual awareness with the blessings of Prabhupada and his guru.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/16.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>He has organised thousands of satsangs in various locations in Lucknow and has been instrumental in spreading the teachings of Krishna consciousness. He has also initiated several new activities, including the construction of a temple, Jagannath Ratha Yatra, Anandam Mahotsav, Deepotsav, and others.</p>
